# Radial-Schrodinger-equation-Hydrogen
Python project solving the radial part of the time-independent Schrödinger equation for hydrogen, including computation of energy eigenvalues and radial wavefunctions.

This project focuses on the numerical solution of the radial part of the
time-independent Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen atom using Python.

The work arises from undergraduate quantum mechanics coursework and
demonstrates the application of computational methods to bound-state
quantum systems.

Physical Background
By separating variables in the Schrödinger equation under a Coulomb
potential, the problem reduces to a one-dimensional radial differential
equation. This project solves the radial equation for bound states and
analyzes the resulting energy eigenvalues and radial wavefunctions.

Methods
- Separation of variables in spherical coordinates
- Finite difference method for the radial equation
- Numerical eigenvalue solving

Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

Results
- Numerical computation of hydrogen energy eigenvalues
- Visualization of radial wavefunctions
- Comparison with analytical hydrogenic solutions

Academic Context
This project was developed as part of undergraduate studies in Physics
and Chemistry and reflects training in computational quantum mechanics.
